# gsp-openmetadata-sidecar

Recover SQL lineage that OpenMetadata's parser silently drops — MSSQL stored procedures, BigQuery procedural SQL, MERGE column lineage, temp-table hops, and [20+ dialects](https://www.gudusoft.com/sql-dialects/) — using [Gudu SQLFlow](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com), then push the recovered lineage back to OpenMetadata via `PUT /api/v1/lineage`.

Optionally, [auto-create](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in) any missing `Database` / `DatabaseSchema` / `Table` entities before emitting lineage, so SQL referencing not-yet-ingested tables still produces complete graphs.

No changes to OpenMetadata code. Public REST API only.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install gsp-openmetadata-sidecar
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --dry-run --sql "CREATE PROC p AS BEGIN INSERT INTO t2 SELECT a, b FROM t1 END"
```

This command:

- parses the SQL with SQLFlow's free anonymous tier
- prints the extracted lineage edges (`t1 → t2`) to stdout
- does not contact OpenMetadata
- does not require `sidecar.yaml` — if the file is absent, built-in defaults are used

If you see upstream → downstream edges, the tool works in your environment. For more realistic fixtures — MSSQL stored procedures, BigQuery procedural SQL, MERGE column lineage — see [`examples/`](examples/) in the repo:

```bash
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file examples/mssql_stored_procedure.sql --dry-run
```

Everything below is about graduating from that first `--dry-run` to a useful live deployment.

## Choose your path

The sidecar has three onboarding paths with different prerequisites. Pick the row that matches your goal:

| Goal | What you need | Shortest command |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluate lineage extraction | A SQL file or inline SQL | `gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --dry-run` |
| Push lineage to an existing OM catalog | Above + `--om-server`, `--om-token`, `--service-name` (+ `--database-name` if SQL uses short names) | See [Push lineage to OpenMetadata](#push-lineage-to-openmetadata) |
| Push lineage and auto-create missing tables | Above + `--default-database`/`--default-schema` + bot with `Create` RBAC | See [Auto-create missing entities](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in) |

If you're new to OpenMetadata, you will also want to skim the [OpenMetadata primer](#openmetadata-primer-for-first-time-users) once — most first-time friction comes from misunderstanding how OpenMetadata identifies tables, not from bugs in this sidecar.

## When to use this

OpenMetadata uses a three-parser chain (sqlglot → sqlfluff → sqlparse via `collate-sqllineage`) that silently loses lineage on procedural and dialect-specific SQL. Use this sidecar when you see any of:

- MSSQL stored procedures (`BEGIN…END`, `DECLARE`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`)
- MSSQL square-bracket identifiers (`[dbo].[table]`)
- Temp-table intermediates (`#tempTable`), breaking multi-hop lineage
- Multi-statement scripts (`DECLARE`, `IF/THEN`, `CREATE TEMP TABLE`)
- `MERGE INTO … WHEN MATCHED … WHEN NOT MATCHED` column lineage
- Cross-database MSSQL queries
- Lineage against tables that don't exist in OpenMetadata yet (staging, ephemeral, not-yet-ingested sources)

See [Related issues](#related-issues) for upstream tickets.

## Install

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install gsp-openmetadata-sidecar
```

From source (recommended for contributors and environments with an externally managed Python):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --help
```

Requirements:

- Python 3.9+
- Network access to the SQLFlow API (for `anonymous`, `authenticated`, `self_hosted` modes)
- Java 8+ and a licensed `gsqlparser-*-shaded.jar` (for `local_jar` mode only)

## Push lineage to OpenMetadata

To push lineage (instead of dry-running), you need:

1. An OpenMetadata instance with the target tables already ingested — or [`--auto-create-entities`](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in) enabled
2. A JWT token (Settings → Bots in the OpenMetadata UI)
3. The database service name as registered in OpenMetadata

```bash
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar \
  --sql-file stored_proc.sql \
  --om-server http://localhost:8585/api \
  --om-token "eyJ..." \
  --service-name mssql_prod \
  --database-name SalesDB \
  --schema-name dbo
```

Or via a config file. A minimal `sidecar.yaml` for a live run:

```yaml
sqlflow:
  mode: anonymous
  db_vendor: dbvmssql

openmetadata:
  server: http://localhost:8585/api
  token: "eyJ..."
  service_name: mssql_prod
  database_name: SalesDB
  schema_name: dbo
```

```bash
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --config sidecar.yaml --sql-file stored_proc.sql
```

See [`examples/sidecar.yaml.example`](examples/sidecar.yaml.example) for the full annotated version, including `authenticated` / `self_hosted` / `local_jar` and auto-create knobs.

### The flags you'll actually type

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--sql-file` / `--sql` | Input SQL. One file path, or an inline string. |
| `--dry-run` | Skip the write to OpenMetadata; print extracted lineage instead. |
| `--om-server` | OpenMetadata API base URL. **Must include `/api`.** |
| `--om-token` | Bot JWT token. From Settings → Bots in the OM UI. |
| `--service-name` | Database service name as registered in OM. First FQN segment. |
| `--database-name` / `--schema-name` | Fallbacks for FQN assembly when SQL uses short names. |
| `--auto-create-entities` | Opt in to creating missing `Database` / `DatabaseSchema` / `Table` before emitting. |

All other flags are listed in the [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference).

## Which defaults do I need?

The sidecar has two separate layers of defaults with similar-looking names. Confusing them is the most common first-run mistake:

| Layer | Flags | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLFlow (parse-time)** | `--default-server` / `--default-database` / `--default-schema` | Help **SQLFlow understand the SQL**. Fed as request fields so `SELECT * FROM Customers` is parsed as `SalesDB.dbo.Customers` instead of a placeholder. |
| **Sidecar (FQN-assembly)** | `--service-name` / `--database-name` / `--schema-name` | Help the sidecar **build OpenMetadata FQNs**. Fill in missing parts when SQLFlow returns fewer than 3 segments. |

Rules of thumb:

- If your SQL uses fully-qualified names (`[SalesDB].[dbo].[Customers]`), you need only `--service-name`.
- If your SQL uses bare table names, set **both** pairs to the same values so SQLFlow parses correctly *and* the sidecar can build a valid 4-part FQN.
- `--default-*` flags are ignored in `local_jar` mode (with a warning) — the JAR-based `DataFlowAnalyzer` CLI does not accept them.

For the full mechanics, see [FQN resolution and default database/schema](#fqn-resolution-and-default-databaseschema) and [SQLFlow default qualifiers (parse-time)](#sqlflow-default-qualifiers-parse-time) below.

## Common first-run mistakes

A short list of the failure modes most new users hit:

- **`--om-server` missing the `/api` suffix.** It must be `http://host:port/api`, not just `http://host:port`.
- **Confusing `--default-database` with `--database-name`.** See the cheat-sheet above.
- **Expecting `--dry-run` to contact OpenMetadata.** It does not. Drop `--dry-run` for a live run.
- **Expecting `local_jar` mode to honor `--default-*`.** It doesn't — SQLFlow's JAR CLI doesn't accept those.
- **Expecting lineage push to create tables by itself.** It doesn't. Either ingest structure first, or pass [`--auto-create-entities`](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in).
- **Bot token missing `EditLineage`.** `PUT /api/v1/lineage` returns 403. Add the permission or grant the bot the `DataConsumer` role.
- **Expecting column-level lineage after an auto-create run.** Auto-created tables are intentionally skeletal (no columns), so column lineage is suppressed on edges touching them. See [Why isn't there column lineage after auto-create?](#why-isnt-there-column-lineage-after-auto-create) below.

## Common commands

```bash
# Inline SQL (no file required):
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql "CREATE PROC p AS BEGIN INSERT INTO t2 SELECT a, b FROM t1 END" --dry-run

# BigQuery procedural SQL with DECLARE, CREATE TEMP TABLE:
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file examples/bigquery_procedural.sql --db-vendor dbvbigquery --dry-run

# Table-level lineage only (skip column mappings):
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --no-column-lineage --dry-run

# Print raw SQLFlow JSON response to stdout:
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --json --dry-run

# Verbose/debug logging:
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --dry-run -v

# Preview what entities would be auto-created (zero writes):
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --auto-create-entities --dry-run

# Live run with auto-create, conservative cap, fail on any create failure:
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --sql-file proc.sql --auto-create-entities \
  --max-entities-to-create 10 --on-create-failure abort

# Show version:
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --version
```

## Auto-create missing entities (opt-in)

By default, the sidecar only writes lineage *edges*. If a referenced table isn't found in OpenMetadata, it logs `Skipping lineage: upstream table not found: …`, skips that edge, and continues. This is the safe baseline.

With `--auto-create-entities` (or `openmetadata.auto_create_entities: true` in YAML, or `GSP_OM_AUTO_CREATE_ENTITIES=true`), the sidecar runs a pre-pass planner, creates any missing `Database` / `DatabaseSchema` / `Table` via `POST` in strict order, and then emits the lineage. The `DatabaseService` is never auto-created.

When to reach for it:

- SQL references staging / ephemeral / not-yet-onboarded tables
- You can't wait for a metadata ingestion run to populate the catalog
- You want complete lineage graphs *now*, and are willing to accept skeletal (column-less) table entities that a connector can enrich later

### Two hard prerequisites

1. **Set parse-time defaults.** Auto-create refuses to run unless `--default-database` + `--default-schema` are set (or the `openmetadata.*` equivalents). Without them, SQLFlow can return partial identifiers that would otherwise materialize as ghost entities at non-4-part FQNs.
2. **The bot needs `Create` RBAC** on `Database`, `DatabaseSchema`, and `Table`, scoped to the configured service. See the [operator guide](docs/auto-create-operator-guide.md#required-rbac) for a recommended role shape.

### The minimum safe command

```bash
# 1. Dry-run to preview what would be created.
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar \
  --config sidecar.yaml \
  --sql-file my_etl.sql \
  --auto-create-entities \
  --dry-run

# 2. Live run with a conservative cap.
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar \
  --config sidecar.yaml \
  --sql-file my_etl.sql \
  --auto-create-entities \
  --on-create-failure abort \
  --max-entities-to-create 10
```

For safety invariants, rollout recipe, and stop-ship criteria before rolling this out on a real OpenMetadata instance, see [**`docs/auto-create-operator-guide.md`**](docs/auto-create-operator-guide.md).

### Why isn't there column lineage after auto-create?

This is the single biggest surprise on a first auto-create run, so call it out up front:

**Auto-created tables have no columns.** The sidecar POSTs them with `columns: []` because SQLFlow never connected to the source database and therefore doesn't know the column types, lengths, nullability, or ordering. Inventing column metadata on admin-curated entities would be worse than leaving the tables skeletal — an ingestion connector that later scans the source cannot reliably diff-and-merge against placeholder columns.

**Column lineage is then suppressed on every edge touching a skeletal endpoint.** You'll see this in the run summary:

```
Lineage emission complete: 2 emitted, 0 skipped (column lineage suppressed on 2 edges, 0 column-pair(s) filtered)
```

Table-level arrows appear in the OM UI as usual; the thin column-to-column lines inside them do not.

**To get column lineage back**, populate the columns on the tables and re-run the sidecar. Normal path:

1. Run OM's native structural ingestion (Airflow DAG or the Ingestion container) against the source. It fills `columns[]` on the existing skeletal entities.
2. Re-run the sidecar on the same SQL. It finds the tables already exist (via exact FQN lookup), sees they now have columns, and emits full column-level `columnsLineage`.

For a smoke test without a real source database, you can PATCH columns onto the skeletal tables directly:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$GSP_OM_SERVER/v1/tables/name/mssql_prod.sales.dbo.invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GSP_OM_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
  -d '[{"op":"replace","path":"/columns","value":[
        {"name":"InvoiceDate","dataType":"DATETIME"},
        {"name":"CustomerId","dataType":"BIGINT"},
        {"name":"Amount","dataType":"NUMERIC"}]}]'
```

Then re-run the sidecar (no `--auto-create-entities` needed; the tables already exist). Column casing doesn't have to match SQLFlow's output — the sidecar does case-insensitive matching via a lowercase→canonical map.

## Push pre-analyzed lineage (`--from-lineage-json`)

If the SQL has already been analyzed offline — for example by an evaluator that runs the GSP
lineage engine inside your network and writes a `lineage-eval.v1` JSON file — push that file
instead of SQL. No SQL is parsed and no SQLFlow backend is contacted; the sidecar talks only to
OpenMetadata.

```bash
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --from-lineage-json lineage.json --dry-run            # show the plan
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar --from-lineage-json lineage.json \
  --om-server http://localhost:8585/api --om-token "$OM_BOT_JWT" --service-name mssql_prod
```

What gets pushed — every fact in the file carries a `kind`:

| kind | pushed as |
|---|---|
| `COLUMN` | a column mapping in `columnsLineage`. An *indirect* one (role `CONDITION`, `GROUP_BY`, `FILTER` or `JOIN`: the column decides a branch, a group or which rows count, rather than supplying the value) follows `--indirect-columns`, below |
| `ROW_LEVEL`, `TABLE` | a table-level edge only (a row-level fact has no target column) |
| `CONSTANT`, `CALL` | nothing (no source table / a procedure call, not data movement) |

Every fact also says where it comes from: `origin` is `STATIC` (SQL written in the code) or
`DYNAMIC` (reconstructed from a statement the code builds at run time, `EXEC(@sql)`), and
`verification` is `VERIFIED` or `UNVERIFIED`. A static fact is always verified; a dynamic one is
verified when the evaluator resolved both its endpoints against the metadata. An **unverified**
fact is a candidate: it is never pushed, and the plan lists it under "unverified dynamic SQL
candidates" so you can check it yourself. A procedure's `dynamicSql` (its dynamic SQL sites and
what each parameter set its callers pass made of them) is the evaluator's report: it is checked
against the schema like the rest of the file, and nothing in it is pushed.

`--indirect-columns` decides which indirect column facts also become column mappings. Each such
mapping is its own `columnsLineage` entry whose `function` names its type — OpenMetadata shows it
as "SQL Function" when you click the column-level edge:

| `--indirect-columns` | pushed as labelled column mappings | `function` text |
|---|---|---|
| `condition` (default) | `CASE WHEN` conditions only — what OpenMetadata's own parser records too (`credit_limit -> credit_band`) | `CASE WHEN condition` |
| `all` | also `GROUP BY` keys and `WHERE`/`JOIN` columns that target a column (e.g. a `COUNT(*)` over filtered rows) | `GROUP BY key`, `filter (WHERE/HAVING)`, `join condition` |
| `none` | nothing — value lineage only | |

Indirect facts not pushed as column mappings still give the table-level edge. A mapping already
present on the edge is never added twice, and a column that is both a value and a condition is
recorded once, as a value. One exception across runs: a value mapping is not treated as present
just because an earlier push labelled the same pair with one of the types above — it is added as a
value entry of its own, and the earlier labelled entry is left as it was (existing entries are
never modified).

How it writes:

- **The whole file is validated first.** A malformed fact stops the run before anything is sent.
- **Tables are resolved against the catalog before facts are combined.** Names are kept exactly as
  written until then, so `Customers` and `customers` become one edge only if OpenMetadata says
  they are one table. A case-insensitive search result is accepted only when exactly one table
  matches.
- **All procedures are aggregated per resolved table pair**, so two procedures that write
  different columns of the same table end up on one edge with all of their columns.
- **Read-merge-write.** `PUT /v1/lineage` replaces an edge's whole `lineageDetails`, so the sidecar
  reads the existing edge first and only *appends* to it: existing fields and `columnsLineage`
  entries — from OpenMetadata's own ingestion or entered by hand — are never modified; source
  columns not already present are added as new entries of their own. One description line
  (`gsp-openmetadata-sidecar contributors v1: [...]`, JSON) lists the contributing procedures.
- **Reruns are no-ops.** An edge whose merged details equal what the server already has is not
  written again.
- **No guessing.** A column matches as written, then as SQL-unquoted (`[a]]b]` is `a]b`), then
  case-insensitively only if that names exactly one column. Anything else is reported and skipped.
- **Input is validated against the `lineage-eval.v1` contract first**; a malformed file stops the
  run before any request is made.
- `--no-column-lineage` writes table-level edges only (existing column lineage is kept).
- `--auto-create-entities` is not supported in this mode yet: ingest the database's metadata
  with OpenMetadata's connector first.

**Run one writer at a time.** Read-merge-write is not atomic: a sidecar run that overlaps another
sidecar run, or OpenMetadata's own lineage ingestion, on the same edge can lose one side's
additions. Schedule the sidecar after OpenMetadata's ingestion has finished.

Exit code: `0` everything written, `1` unusable input (nothing sent), `2` a lookup or write
failed, `3` finished but some tables were not found or some column mappings were rejected.

## OpenMetadata primer (for first-time users)

If you've never used OpenMetadata before, this section gives you the vocabulary the rest of this README assumes. Skim it before you start passing flags like `--service-name` or `--om-token`.

### The entity hierarchy

OpenMetadata stores metadata as **entities**. Every table, column, dashboard, pipeline, and user is an entity. For SQL lineage you care about three entity types, arranged as a strict 4-level hierarchy:

```
Database Service   (e.g. "mssql_prod")      — a connection to a source system
    └── Database   (e.g. "SalesDB")         — a logical database within that service
        └── Schema (e.g. "dbo")             — a schema/namespace within the database
            └── Table (e.g. "Customers")    — the actual table (with columns inside)
```

Key points for newcomers:

- **Service is not the server.** A service is an OpenMetadata-registered connection. You choose the name when you set it up in the OM UI (Settings → Services → Databases → Add). It is *usually* named after the source system (e.g. `mssql_prod`, `snowflake_analytics`), but it is an opaque identifier — not the SQL Server hostname or DSN.
- **Database ≠ schema.** For MSSQL, `SalesDB.dbo.Customers` has database `SalesDB` and schema `dbo`. For PostgreSQL or Snowflake, same structure. For MySQL there's effectively no separate schema level, so OM stores a synthetic schema called `default`.
- **Columns live inside the table entity**, not as standalone entities with their own URLs. Column lineage is expressed *within* a table-to-table lineage edge.

### Fully-Qualified Name (FQN)

An FQN is how OpenMetadata uniquely identifies an entity across the whole catalog. For tables the shape is:

```
service.database.schema.table
```

Concrete example:

```
mssql_prod.SalesDB.dbo.Customers
```

Things worth knowing up front:

- **FQNs are case-preserving but the API lookup is case-sensitive by default.** `mssql_prod.SalesDB.dbo.Customers` and `mssql_prod.salesdb.dbo.customers` are treated as different FQNs by the direct lookup endpoint `GET /api/v1/tables/name/{fqn}`. This sidecar handles that by falling back to a case-insensitive search — but it's still the single biggest source of "why can't it find my table?" confusion.
- **Segments containing dots or special characters are quoted.** `mssql_prod."My.Database".dbo."Order Details"` is a valid FQN. The sidecar does not currently emit quoted segments, so avoid dots in names if you can.
- **The service segment is chosen by whoever registered the service**, not derived from the SQL. This is why the sidecar needs `--service-name` — SQLFlow can tell you the SQL said `SalesDB.dbo.Customers`, but only you know that `SalesDB` sits under the OM service named `mssql_prod`.

### Ingestion vs lineage

OpenMetadata distinguishes two kinds of metadata:

1. **Structural ingestion** — creates the table entities themselves by inspecting the source system's information_schema (or equivalent). Usually runs on a schedule as an Airflow DAG or as the OM Ingestion container. Produces rows in `tables`, `databases`, `schemas`, etc.
2. **Lineage ingestion** — creates directed edges *between* existing table entities. Produces rows in `entity_relationship` with relation type `upstream`.

By default, lineage ingestion does not create tables. This sidecar can optionally auto-create missing `Database` / `DatabaseSchema` / `Table` entities before emission (see [Auto-create missing entities](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in)) — but in the default mode, if `SalesDB.dbo.Customers` doesn't already exist as a table entity, you cannot attach lineage to it.

When the sidecar logs `Skipping lineage: upstream table not found: mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers`, it means: "I asked OM for that FQN and got a 404 (even after case-insensitive fallback). The SQL references a table that OM doesn't know about yet."

### Table-level vs column-level lineage

- **Table-level lineage** — a directed edge between two table entities. Answers *"does data flow from A to B?"*. Persisted as a single row per edge.
- **Column-level lineage** — on top of the table edge, a list of column mappings: *"column `A.orderId` feeds column `B.orderId`, and columns `A.firstName + A.lastName` feed column `B.fullName`"*. Persisted inside the edge's `lineageDetails.columnsLineage` JSON field.

OpenMetadata's UI renders column lineage as thin lines between column pills inside each table card. You only get those lines if the sidecar populated `columnsLineage`. Turn it off with `--no-column-lineage` if you only want table-level arrows.

### Authentication: Bots and JWT tokens

OpenMetadata's REST API uses bearer-token auth. For automated tools (like this sidecar), the recommended pattern is:

1. In the OM UI: **Settings → Bots → Add new bot** (e.g. `lineage-sidecar-bot`).
2. Generate a JWT token for that bot. Copy it immediately — OM only shows it once.
3. Pass it to the sidecar via `--om-token` or the `GSP_OM_TOKEN` env var.

Bot tokens are long-lived by default (OM rotates them only when you regenerate). Treat them like passwords. The token carries the bot's role — make sure the bot has the `DataConsumer` role plus `EditLineage` permission, otherwise the `PUT /api/v1/lineage` call will return 403.

### The lineage API this sidecar uses

The sidecar pushes edges via:

```
PUT /api/v1/lineage
{
  "edge": {
    "fromEntity": { "id": "<upstream-uuid>",   "type": "table" },
    "toEntity":   { "id": "<downstream-uuid>", "type": "table" },
    "lineageDetails": {
      "sqlQuery": "CREATE PROC ...",
      "source":   "QueryLineage",
      "columnsLineage": [ { "fromColumns": [...], "toColumn": "..." } ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that both sides are identified by **entity UUID**, not FQN. The sidecar resolves FQN → UUID itself (step [4] in the pipeline diagram below). That lookup is where FQN correctness pays off: a wrong FQN means a 404 means a skipped edge.

### How these concepts map to sidecar flags

| OM concept | Sidecar flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Database service name | `--service-name` | First FQN segment. Default: `mssql`. |
| Database | `--database-name` | Fills FQN when SQL has 1- or 2-part names. No default. |
| Schema | `--schema-name` | Fills FQN when SQL has 1-part names. Default: `dbo`. |
| OM server URL | `--om-server` | E.g. `http://localhost:8585/api` (note the `/api` suffix). |
| Bot JWT token | `--om-token` | From Settings → Bots. |
| Column lineage toggle | `--column-lineage` / `--no-column-lineage` | Default: on. |

## How it works

The sidecar is a bridge between **SQLFlow** (which understands SQL) and **OpenMetadata** (which stores metadata). SQL syntax parsing is delegated to SQLFlow — the sidecar decides how the file is chunked, maps the result to OpenMetadata entities, and pushes lineage edges.

### Pipeline

```
SQL file / inline SQL
        |
        v
  [1] SQLFlow backend ── parses SQL, returns table & column relationships
        |                 (sidecar sends raw SQL + dialect, nothing else)
        v
  [2] Lineage mapper ── extracts upstream/downstream table pairs + column mappings
        |                from SQLFlow's JSON response
        v
  [3] FQN builder ───── converts SQLFlow table names (e.g. SALESDB.DBO.CUSTOMERS)
        |                to OpenMetadata FQNs (e.g. mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers)
        |                using --service-name, --database-name, --schema-name
        v
  [4] Entity lookup ─── looks up each FQN in OpenMetadata to get entity UUIDs
        |                (exact match first, then case-insensitive search fallback)

### Where do table/column names come from?

**All table and column names come from SQLFlow, not from the sidecar — and nothing is generated by a language model.** SQLFlow is a deterministic SQL parser (Gudu Soft's General SQL Parser). The sidecar's Python is a mapper/translator, not a parser.

SQLFlow's JSON response has two branches the sidecar reads:

- **`dbobjs`** — a tree of `servers → databases → schemas → tables[]/views[]`. This is SQLFlow's inferred catalog from the SQL (with `--default-server/database/schema` applied at parse time). `src/gsp_openmetadata_sidecar/lineage_mapper.py::_build_id_to_fqn` walks it to produce `{sqlflow_entity_id: "server.db.schema.table"}`.
- **`relationships[]`** — column-level flow edges, each with a `target` and `sources[]`. `lineage_mapper.py::extract_lineage` filters to persistent effects (`create_view`, `insert`, `merge`, …), resolves intermediate result-sets (`RS-*`, `MERGE-INSERT-*`) transitively back to real tables, and emits `TableLineage(upstream_table, downstream_table, column_mappings[])` dataclasses.

The `upstream_table` / `downstream_table` strings are the tables that need to exist in OpenMetadata. `emitter.py` then completes them to 4-part FQNs via `_build_fqn` (using `--service-name`, `--database-name`, `--schema-name` as fallbacks) and does `GET /api/v1/tables/name/{fqn}` to resolve them to UUIDs.

Example — given this SQL:

```sql
CREATE VIEW [ReportDB].[dbo].[vw_CustomerOrders] AS
SELECT [SalesDB].[dbo].[Customers].[CustomerID],
       [SalesDB].[dbo].[Orders].[OrderDate]
FROM [SalesDB].[dbo].[Customers]
JOIN [SalesDB].[dbo].[Orders] ON ...
```

SQLFlow returns relationships like:
- `SALESDB.DBO.CUSTOMERS.CUSTOMERID` → `REPORTDB.DBO.VW_CUSTOMERORDERS.CUSTOMERID`
- `SALESDB.DBO.ORDERS.ORDERDATE` → `REPORTDB.DBO.VW_CUSTOMERORDERS.ORDERDATE`

The sidecar reads these and builds lineage edges.

> **Implication for auto-creation of missing entities:** SQLFlow's JSON is authoritative for the *identity* and *hierarchy* (service/db/schema/table) of every referenced table, because those are what it parsed from the SQL. It is **not** authoritative for source-table columns, types, descriptions, or owners — SQLFlow never connected to the source database. The auto-create path therefore creates tables with an empty columns array and leaves column-level enrichment to a real ingestion connector.

### What happens when tables don't exist in OpenMetadata?

There are two modes, chosen per-run:

**Default (feature off):** the sidecar only creates lineage *edges*. If a referenced table isn't found, it logs `Skipping lineage: upstream table not found: mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers`, skips that edge, and keeps going for the rest. This is the safe baseline — nothing is ever written to the catalog beyond lineage.

**Opt-in (`--auto-create-entities`):** the sidecar runs a pre-pass planner, creates any missing `Database` / `DatabaseSchema` / `Table` via `POST` (never `PUT`, never `DatabaseService`), enforces a hard safety cap, and then emits the lineage. Column lineage is suppressed on edges touching freshly-created or column-less endpoints — the sidecar never invents columns. See [`docs/auto-create-operator-guide.md`](docs/auto-create-operator-guide.md) for safety invariants, RBAC requirements, and the rollout recipe.

In either mode, running OpenMetadata's native metadata ingestion first remains the recommended way to populate the catalog — auto-create is a fallback for tables ingestion can't see (ephemeral staging, ad-hoc sources, pre-onboarding pilots).

### Case-insensitive entity matching

SQLFlow uppercases identifiers for case-insensitive databases (MSSQL, etc.), but OpenMetadata may store them in mixed case (e.g. `Customers` not `CUSTOMERS`). The sidecar:

1. First tries an exact FQN lookup: `GET /api/v1/tables/name/mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers`
2. On 404, falls back to the search API (case-insensitive)
3. Picks the best match (exact case-insensitive FQN match wins)

## FQN resolution and default database/schema

OpenMetadata identifies tables by FQN: `service.database.schema.table`. The sidecar builds FQNs from SQLFlow's output using the defaults you provide.

### How defaults work

When SQL references a table without a full `database.schema.table` path, SQLFlow returns only the parts present in the SQL. The sidecar fills in missing parts from your `--database-name` and `--schema-name` settings:

| Parts in SQL | SQLFlow returns | Sidecar fills in from defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `customers` (1-part) | `CUSTOMERS` | database from `--database-name`, schema from `--schema-name` |
| `dbo.customers` (2-part) | `DBO.CUSTOMERS` | database from `--database-name` |
| `SalesDB.dbo.customers` (3-part) | `SALESDB.DBO.CUSTOMERS` | nothing — all parts present |

**Important: `--database-name` and `--schema-name` are NOT sent to SQLFlow.** They are used only on the sidecar side for FQN assembly. SQLFlow receives only the raw SQL text and the `--db-vendor` dialect flag.

### Defaults

| Setting | Default | When used |
|---|---|---|
| `--service-name` | `mssql` | Always prepended as the first FQN segment |
| `--database-name` | *(none)* | Used when SQL has 1-part or 2-part table names |
| `--schema-name` | `dbo` | Used when SQL has 1-part table names |

### Examples

| SQL reference | Config | Resolved FQN |
|---|---|---|
| `customers` | `--service-name mssql --database-name SalesDB --schema-name dbo` | `mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers` |
| `dbo.customers` | `--service-name mssql --database-name SalesDB` | `mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers` |
| `SalesDB.dbo.customers` | `--service-name mssql` | `mssql.salesdb.dbo.customers` |
| `[Sales].[dbo].[Invoices]` | `--service-name mssql` | `mssql.sales.dbo.invoices` |

Square brackets, backticks, and quotes are automatically stripped. All table/database/schema names from SQL are lowercased during FQN construction (with case-insensitive search fallback).

## SQLFlow default qualifiers (parse-time)

`--default-server`, `--default-database`, and `--default-schema` are sent to SQLFlow as the `defaultServer` / `defaultDatabase` / `defaultSchema` request fields. They influence how SQLFlow *parses* unqualified references — before lineage ever reaches the sidecar. This is a different layer from `--database-name` / `--schema-name`, which only fill in the OM FQN on the sidecar side. Set both pairs (or neither) depending on which layer needs the default.

| Layer | Flags | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| SQLFlow (parse-time) | `--default-server` / `--default-database` / `--default-schema` | SQLFlow populates the server/database/schema of its output tree so unqualified SQL (e.g. `SELECT * FROM Customers`) resolves to a real qualified table instead of the placeholder `DEFAULT_SERVER.DEFAULT.DEFAULT.Customers`. |
| Sidecar (FQN-assembly) | `--service-name` / `--database-name` / `--schema-name` | Sidecar builds OpenMetadata FQNs from SQLFlow's output. Fills in missing parts when SQLFlow returned fewer than 3 segments. |

Typical pairing:

```bash
gsp-openmetadata-sidecar \
  --sql "SELECT * FROM Customers" \
  --default-database SalesDB --default-schema dbo \
  --service-name mssql_prod --database-name SalesDB --schema-name dbo \
  --dry-run
```

Without the `--default-*` flags, SQLFlow returns `CUSTOMERS` as a one-part name and the sidecar fills in from `--database-name` / `--schema-name`. With them, SQLFlow's tree itself carries `SalesDB.dbo.Customers`, the mapper prefers that qualified form, and the sidecar-side defaults become load-bearing only for references SQLFlow couldn't qualify at all.

The three flags are only applied by the HTTP backends. In `local_jar` mode they are ignored with a warning, because the `DataFlowAnalyzer` CLI does not expose them.

## Input handling

The sidecar does not do SQL lineage parsing itself, but it does decide how input files are chunked before calling SQLFlow:

- **Procedural files** — if the file contains `DECLARE`, `BEGIN`, `IF … THEN`, `CALL`, `LOOP`, `EXCEPTION WHEN`, `END LOOP`, `END IF`, or `WHILE`, the entire file is sent as a single statement. Splitting on semicolons would break the procedural block.
- **Non-procedural files** — the file is split on `;` and each statement is sent to SQLFlow independently.
- **Inline SQL** (`--sql`) — always sent as a single statement.

Statement-boundary detection is heuristic: it keys off keyword presence, not full SQL parsing. If a non-procedural file has lineage issues from the split, try running it through the `--sql` path as one block.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

**`ValueError: sqlflow.user_id and sqlflow.secret_key are both required when mode is 'authenticated'`**
`authenticated` mode needs *both* credentials. Set `GSP_SQLFLOW_USER_ID` + `GSP_SQLFLOW_SECRET_KEY`, or pass `--user-id` + `--secret-key`.

**`Anonymous API rate limit exceeded`**
The anonymous tier is 50 calls/day per IP. The tool exits with code `2` on this error. Switch to `authenticated` (10k/month) or `self_hosted` (unlimited).

**`Skipping lineage: upstream table not found: …`**
That FQN does not exist in OpenMetadata. Run OpenMetadata ingestion first, create the table entity, or re-run with `--auto-create-entities` (see [Auto-create missing entities](#auto-create-missing-entities-opt-in)). The sidecar keeps going and emits the other edges it *can* resolve — a single file can partially succeed.

**`auto_create_entities=true requires sqlflow.default_database … AND sqlflow.default_schema …`**
Auto-create refuses to run without defaults because partial SQL references (e.g. bare `customers`) would otherwise synthesize ghost entities at non-4-part FQNs. Set `--default-database` + `--default-schema` (or the `openmetadata.database_name` / `schema_name` equivalents).

**`Plan would create N entities; max_entities_to_create=M`**
The pre-pass planner counted more missing entities than `--max-entities-to-create` (default 100) allows. Re-run with `--dry-run` to review the full tree, confirm the count matches your expectation, then raise `--max-entities-to-create` explicitly.

**`OpenMetadata rejected the minimal create payload … at preflight`**
Auto-create's first write returned HTTP 400. Your OpenMetadata version may have tightened payload validation beyond what the sidecar expects. See [`docs/entity-emission-api-evidence.md`](docs/entity-emission-api-evidence.md) for the payload shapes the sidecar sends. File an issue with the OM version + 400 body.

**`Auto-create refuses foreign service 'X' (configured: 'Y')`**
A lineage FQN named an OpenMetadata service other than the one you configured. Either the SQL or an upstream emitter labeled the lineage incorrectly. The sidecar is single-service by design; run once per service.

**Multi-statement files can partially succeed.** Per-statement errors are logged and counted, but processing continues through the rest of the file. The process still exits with code `1` if any statement failed.

**Large SQL is truncated in the stored `sqlQuery`.** OpenMetadata's `lineageDetails.sqlQuery` field is capped at 10,000 characters when the sidecar builds the payload. The lineage edges themselves are unaffected.

**`local_jar: jar not found at …`**
The sidecar does not bundle the SQLFlow JAR. Point `--jar-path` (or `GSP_JAR_PATH`) at a licensed `gsqlparser-*-shaded.jar`.

**JVM cold-start with `local_jar`.** Each call spawns a fresh `java` process (~0.5–1 s overhead). Fine for ad-hoc files; not ideal for log ingestion with hundreds of statements.
